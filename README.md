A simple server in rust for use in our iOS course.

> "it would be so funky fresh if we had 1 rust repo" - Alicia Wang

## Running
Make sure you have [rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.
Simply run `cargo run` in the root of this project to run the server. 
It currently binds to port 8080.
