    "I guess this place only makes sense if you are used to coming here. Otherwise, you're left to guess what to do. For those of you equally confused as I was, youll need to walk to the back of the restaurant to order.",
    "Sandwiches were pretty good, but we went at 10:30 am on a Friday and they only had salt bagels left...bagels is in their name.",
    "All the staff is so unpleasant and unkind. Food is always cold or messed up when you get it.",
    "My best friend went to Cornell and for years I have heard her profess her love for Collegetown Bagels. Well, she was RIGHT!!",
    "Really delicious! Their menu has so many options, and the drinks they create include local landmarks and are so unique."
