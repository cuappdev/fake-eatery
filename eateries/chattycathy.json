    "Cute little spot in collegetown. We're talking tiny, but more cozy than cramped and it actually works for the type of place it is.",
    "I feel like açaí bowls are a rare commodity in upstate NY, so I always enjoy going to places that serve them.",
    "I had never tried one before this place so it was nice to try something new. I recommend if you are looking for something new.",
    "The coffee was terrible in my case. Probably not all the stuff knows how to prepare an espresso drink."
