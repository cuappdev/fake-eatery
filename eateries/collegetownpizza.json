    "The pizza is good, but be warned if you are ordering take-out with certain toppings.",
    "They touched my food with dirty hands. Rude and unprofessional. The food is alright but the service and remarkably heinous due to their incompetent employees. Would not go again.",
    "Yesterday I had pizza at Zachary's in Berkeley and it was ok. Today I had pizza here and it was amazing.",
    "Worst pizza I've ever had.",
    "I've never been quite a big fan of CTP, but their service and product are both so horrific that I've decided that putting up with it is not worth it."
