    "Their Chinese food is the best in Ithaca in my opinion!",
    "I came here a while ago, but this place has the most authentic Chinese food in Collegetown.",
    "This was probably my favorite place to eat in Collegetown, or even Ithaca for that matter.",
    "The dishes are a bit pricey, but not much of a surprise there, since it is collegetown. There's lunch specials though. Monday to Friday."
