    "Great place for readily accessible, cheap Chinese food!! Go for the spicy dishes if you can take it (see my photo).",
    "The food is average at best (though the portions for the price ($10 for rice with three items) were fairly generous.  My General Tso's chicken was dry and did not have much flavor, a pattern repeated with the rest of my food.",
    "Our ToGo restaurant in C Town. There are classics and surprises everyday. saucy but tasty!",
    "Fast food restaurant on par with Chinese university campus canteens. Could be pretty handy when the weather is bad since it is right there in the college town.",
    "A lot of my fellow Cornellians really don't like how the food is but I think its amazing. Their sirloin over rice seriously hits the spot. I honestly love coming here."
