    "I'm not sure what people are complaining about when it comes to staff and customer service - everyone there has been friendly in my experience, and I went my entire four years as a Cornell student very regularly.",
    "Given current conditions and economic struggles of many in the hospitality / restaurant industry, I'm 100% understanding of how Jack's might not have the typical inventory of ingredients.",
    "Horrible service- honestly expected more customer service and understanding but no.",
    "So they charged our credit card 2 additional times for single order. Returned to the establishment after reviewing online bank statement and alerted staff of the error.",
    "Visited to take advantage of the BOGO Frosty deal they were offering. Didn't like the set up -- you order on a computer screen and there are no people regularly at the counter to speak with you."
