    "Hands down some of the WORST food I've ever had. My partner and I ordered six dishes and half of them were okay at best.",
    "Great place for casual eating. Very cheap and fast. Also Thai Tea fit with any of food in the restaurant",
    "Passable spicy Basil fried rice, though you'll be much better off going downtown to the Thai Basil place.",
    "Lemon grass chicken was one of the best in town. Noodles are fabulous, definitely of my taste. Atmosphere was good. Service better than most other shops in town.",
    "This restaurant has one of the worst spicy basil noodles that I have ever eaten. The flavor is bland. "
