    "Depends on what you order. My personal favorites are je yook bok um and squid fried rice.",
    "Not very crowded for a Friday night. Our server was very attentive and kept checking in how we were doing.",
    "The salmon was good sized and cooked to perfection. It had a tasty seasoning but not so much as to overpower the fish. The vegetables had a nice Brown sugar like glaze that also was not overpowering and added a good flavor to them as well.",
    "A to go place if you're craving for Korean food when you're in upstate New York. We ordered the sea food hotpot, Korean bbq- beef short ribs and bogogi."
