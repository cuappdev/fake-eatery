    "Every restaurants have their target groups. If you are looking for a nice, fancy restaurant or want to experience a real, authentic Thai food, this is not a place to go to.",
    "Stir fry veggies and Chinese BBQ pork w/ a lot of rice for dinner. Flavors are good, but the texture needs improvement.",
    "The good thing about it was that the portion sizes were very large and it was at an affordable price. It's good for starving college kids on a budget.",
    "Best value in collegetown for a lot of food, a decent variety of vegetables, meat, and soup slathered in flavor.",
    "Food is bad compared to the Thai in town, but it was palatable enough. "
